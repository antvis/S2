Fill in the relevant information according to the Issue template. Yes, these steps are a little cumbersome, but they are necessary. Each user has different scenarios, system environment, software version, or some specific steps are required to reproduce the bug. Saying it clearly at this time can save everyone's time!

## Development Process

We use `pnpm@v7` for package management

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

1. `pnpm install` installation dependencies
2. `pnpm site:start` starts the local `S2` website
3. `pnpm core:start` uses a visual way to debug the single test of the core layer (based on jest-electron)
4. `pnpm react:start` can debug the unit test of the React version in a visual way (based on jest-electron)
5. `pnpm react:playground` starts a local interactive React version Demo (based on vite)
6. `pnpm vue:playground` starts a local interactive Vue3 version Demo (based on vite)
7. `pnpm build` builds `@antv/s2` , `@antv/s2-react` and `@antv/s2-vue` 3 packages, and outputs `umd` , `esm` and `lib` directories respectively
8. `pnpm test` runs unit tests
9. `pnpm lint` static code detection
