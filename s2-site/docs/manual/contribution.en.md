## Development Process

We use `pnpm@v7` as a package manager

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

1. `pnpm` Install dependencies
2. `pnpm site:start` start local`S2` website
3. `pnpm core:start` Use a visual way to debug the single test of the core layer (based on jest-electron)
4. `pnpm react:start` Debug React version unit tests in a visual way (based on jest-electron)
5. `pnpm react:playground` Start a local interactive React version Demo (vite based)
6. `pnpm vue:playground` Start a local interactive Vue3 version Demo (based on vite)
7. `pnpm build` Construct `@antv/s2`,`@antv/s2-react` and `@antv/s2-vue` 3 packets, output separately`umd`,`esm` and `lib` Table of contents
8. `pnpm test` run unit tests
9. `pnpm lint` Static code detection
