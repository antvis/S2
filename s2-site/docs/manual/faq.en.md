```ts
pivotSheet.setDataCfg({ ... }, true)
pivotSheet.render(true) // re-render and update data
```

Update theme:[optional](#/en/docs/api/general/S2Theme)

```ts
pivotSheet.setThemeCfg({ ... })
pivotSheet.render(false) // re-render without updating data
```

### The chart can't be rendered, what's going on?

The chart needs to be mounted in`dom` node, make sure the node exists

```html
<div id="container"></div>
```

```ts
const pivotSheet = new PivotSheet(document.getElementById('container'), dataCfg, options);
```

If a selector is passed in, S2 will use[`document.querySelector()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) to find, which means that as long as the node exists and the selector matches`querySelector` syntax is possible

```ts
const pivotSheet = new PivotSheet('#container', dataCfg, options);
const pivotSheet = new PivotSheet('.container', dataCfg, options);
const pivotSheet = new PivotSheet('#container > div', dataCfg, options);
const pivotSheet = new PivotSheet('#container > div[title="xx"]', dataCfg, options);
```

### Why is the scroll bar not displayed after manually updating the width and height of the table?

The form is not aware of changes and needs to be called once after updating the configuration`render` method triggers an update

```ts
s2.changeSheetSize(200, 200)
s2.render(false)
```

### Can the table automatically fill according to the width and height of the outer container?
